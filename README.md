# **Project Concoction**
### This is a game made for Bevy Jam 3

This branch contains version of the game (or rather prototype) that was uploaded to the GameJam.

The code is quite unreadable, I am very sorry for that one. I was really time constrained.
Last day I just splattered systems whenever I could cram them, project and structure is in chaos.

Feel free to look at this code and reuse parts of it in your games
